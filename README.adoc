This project makes your Spring Boot actuators start up lazily, saving
quite a chunk of time on startup (400-600ms out of 1800-2000ms in a
simple single-endpoint demo app). The first time an actuator endpoint
is queried over HTTP, you pay back the cost on the first request. It
works by creating a child application context with just the actuator
autoconfig in it.

It also makes every bean `@Lazy` by default, which boosts startup time
of any Spring Boot app, in the case that you don't use all the
autoconfigured beans.

You can switch off the laziness with `spring.lazy.enabled=false`
(system property, command line etc.).
